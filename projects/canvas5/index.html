                    <p>Built around constructors contained in the Canvas5 namespace, making the game's sprites and elements contained in objects provides much more portability and ease. You can even use the objects without the built-in rendering engine, and use them as a simple container for common game entity properties, such as position, sprite sheet animation, and more!</p>

                    <h3 class="text-center">Rendering</h3>
                    <p>The Canvas5 engine comes built-in with an automatic collision detection system and renderer. No need to write your own algorithms; just call Canvas5.render()! However, the current used algorithms are not fullproof quite yet, so any contributions concerning it would greatly help.</p>
